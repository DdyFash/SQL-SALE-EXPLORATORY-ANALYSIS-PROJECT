# SQL SALE EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS PROJECT

üìä **Project Overview**  
This repository contains SQL queries used for analyzing sales data in order to gain insights into product performance, regional sales, sales representative performance, payment methods, and much more. The queries cover a variety of levels from basic to advanced, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the sales data.

## üìÅ Queries Overview

The SQL queries focus on extracting meaningful insights from a sales database (`sales_data1`). This data includes information on product sales, regions, sales representatives, payment methods, and sales channels.

**Data Source:**  
`[dbo].[sales_data1]` - Contains information such as Product ID, Sales Date, Sales Rep, Region, Sales Amount, Quantity Sold, Product Category, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Customer Type, Discount, Payment Method, and Sales Channel.
